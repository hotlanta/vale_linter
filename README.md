Vale is a grammar, style, and word usage linter for the English language. Vale "offers a framework for creating and enforcing custom rules. Its approach is much more similar to code linters than it is to traditional grammar checkers."

The type of files linted are the following:
* HTML
* Plain text (*.txt)
* [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
* [Asciidoc](https://asciidoc.org/)
* [reStructuredText](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/)
* [DITA](https://www.dita-ot.org/)
* [XML](http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc.html)
* [Org](https://orgmode.org/)
* [Source code comments](https://vale.sh/docs/topics/scoping#code-1)

Vale’s configuration needs to be stored in the .vale.ini file located in the root directory of a project. The styles folder can be referenced by an absolute path or a relative path.

The styles and config files will undergo regular updates so [keep your fork in sync](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow).

**The Vale files in this repo implement the HPE style guide.**
