Vale is a grammar, style, and word usage linter for the English language. Valeâ€™s configuration needs to be stored in the .vale.ini file located in the root directory of a project. The styles folder should also be stored in the root directory of a project.

The Vale files in this repo implement the HPE style guide.

To check a file(s) the following command can be used in CLI:
vale file._ file._ ...

1. [Vale installation instructions](https://docs.errata.ai/vale/install) -- <b>Note: Run Windows Powershell as an Admin!</b>

    - Copy [Vale styles folder](https://github.com/hotlanta/vale_linter/tree/main/styles) to your local repo and modify as needed. The styles found here are based on the HPE style guide, plus spell checker,, spelling exceptions, and some common sense styles (base folder).
    
    - Copy [.vale.ini](https://github.com/hotlanta/vale_linter/blob/main/.vale.ini) file to your local repo and modify as needed.
